We can find the quiz in [PTBR]( https://docs.google.com/a/computacao.ufcg.edu.br/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=Y29tcHV0YWNhby51ZmNnLmVkdS5icnxsZWRhdWZjZ3xneDoxY2FiMzc3N2I4Y2VhYjA0)


##1. What the diference between overload and override?

In an overload we replicated a method with the same return and name. However, the assignature is different. In other words, the input parameters are different between the overload's methods. 

However, in an overload, a method define in a superclass, it is rewrite with the same name e the return type but, another implementation of the code.

##2. When use the override? 

When a concrete class inheterance a abstract class and it is necessary implement the abstract's methods. Or when if is necessary modify the implementation of inherited method. 

##3. What is abstract class and when to use them? 

class that are not totally complete(abstract class), in other words, has methods without implementation (abstract methods), just a definition. Are used when the method's implementation between subclass are differents. So, the abstract method works like a contract. here each subclass has the mandotory of implemetantion the abstract methods. 

##4. What is casts? How to use casts and instanceof?

We use casting for convert a object type in another object type, like the conversion between double and int. The instanceof is used when is necessary know about the type of anyone object. 

##5. What the difference between interfaces and abstract class? hat situations require the use of interface rather than abstract class?

Interface define a contract, in other words, the class that implement anyone interface has the mandatory of implemented all the methods that contains inside the interface, at the same time, a object can implement how many interfaces you want. Interfaces dont contains attributes. Abstract class works like a contract too, but contains attributes which are also inherited. Futhermore, a class can implementend a single abstract class, different from interfaces.
